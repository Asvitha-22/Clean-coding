Dependency Injection	Provide dependencies from outside the class	Decoupling and easier testing

| Component                     | Role                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `INotificationService`        | Interface (abstract dependency)         |
| `EmailService` / `SMSService` | Concrete implementations                |
| `NotificationManager`         | Class that **depends on** the interface |
| `make_unique(...)`            | **Injects** the desired dependency      |


Benefits of DI in This Example

    Loosely Coupled: NotificationManager doesn't care how the notification is sent.

    Easily Swappable: Change behavior at runtime.

    Testable: You can inject a mock service during unit testing.

    Flexible: You can extend by adding new services (e.g., WhatsAppService) without touching NotificationManager.
